### 1. What is <g:meta name="app.name"/>?
Startup project designed to ease and accelerate software development.
Ideal for startups and web developers who want to rapid-prototype and develop products within weeks without wasting time in configurations and boring stuff.
Software development never has been so fast!

### 2. Requirements
**Grails Boostrap** is based in Grails.

- [Grails](http://grails.org): Grails is an Open Source, full stack, web application framework for the JVM. It takes advantage of the Groovy programming language and convention
over configuration to provide a productive and stream-lined development experience.
- [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/es/java/javase/downloads/index.html): Grails runs on the JVM, so you will need the latest JDK 1.6 or JDK 1.7 to use it.

### 3. Getting started
It is very easy to start to develop with **Grails Boostrap**, that's the key of the tool. Download it and start to develop within minutes.

<pre>
git clone https://url.com
grails run-app
</pre>
And you will be able to access to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and see the public website.
### 4. Develop
There are three main IDEs that have good integration with Grails:

- [Intellij-IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/groovy.html)
- [Eclipse (ggts)](http://spring.io/tools/ggts)
- [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/web/grails-quickstart.html)
